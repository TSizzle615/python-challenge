This repository contains the material for the Module 3 Challenge.  This challenge is late due to the stroke my mother-in-law had during the assingment period, but wanted to make sure I did the work.  This repository contains the required information as outlined in the challenge documentation.

First is an analysis of bank data to calculate the following values:
  *The total number of months in the dataset
  *The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  *The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  *The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  *The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Second was an analysis to help a small rural town modernize its vote-counting by analyzing the following:
  *The total number of votes cast
  *A complete list of candidates who received votes
  *The percentage of votes each candidate won
  *The total number of votes each candidate won
  *The winner of the election

Each of the above was presented in the manner proscribed.

All coding was done by Scott Zach.  Google searches were utilized for syntax questions.
